\begin{abstract}
  In creating version 2 of the ``Space-Time Coordinate Metadata for the Virtual Observatory'' (STC) Data Model \citep{2007ivoa.spec.1030R}, it was decided to split the content into various component models which focus on particular aspects of the previous model scope.  
  
  This model describes the Coordinates model and covers the following concepts.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Description of single and multi-dimensional coordinate space, and coordinates within that space.
  \item Coordinate Frames, providing metadata describing the origin and orientation of the coordinate space.
  \item Definition of simple domain-specific coordinate types for the most common use cases.
  \item Coordinate Systems, description of the coordinate domain space.
  \end{itemize}
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}
Astronomy, being primarily a science that crucially depends on observations, has a very basic 
need for complete, accurate, and unambiguous metadata regarding coordinate information, meaning 
all coordinates of the observable space and noting that several of these are intertwined. This 
document aims to provide a data model for such metadata.

\subsection{Context and Scope}
This document results from updating the \href{http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/STC.html}{``Space-Time Coordinate Metadata for the Virtual Observatory''} (STC) \citep{2007ivoa.spec.1030R} model for use in VO-DML compliant models. That model provides metadata describing Space-Time related, and other Coordinates. These metadata are to be used for specifying coordinate-related information for datasets, catalogs, and queries.  In this work, our primary focus is to support the use cases described below, while keeping the broader scope in mind to inform design decisions for future expansion.

The update and revision of the STC model has sub-divided the content into component models, each covering a portion of the scope of the parent model.  This allows for a better description of the relations between the various components, allows for independent development of the component models, and creates smaller, more digestible content for users.

In the astronomical community, the terms ``quantity'', ``coordinate'', and ``measurement'' are used interchangably, but not always 
with the same meaning.  The ``coordinate'' of a star is typically a measured location, while the ``coordinate'' of the center
of a circular region is not.  We provide here a short glossary of these terms in the IVOA data model context.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Quantity: [ivoa model]  A number with a unit.
  \item Coordinate: [coords model]  An absolute location within a coordinate space.  Comprised of a 'value' (often a Quantity), 
associated with an axis in a coordinate space, and a coordinate frame providing additional metadata about the orientation and origin of the coordinate space.
In other words, a location in a domain space.
  \item Measurement: [meas model]  For 'measured', or 'determined' data.  Combines a Coordinate (ie: the determined value) with 
corresponding Error(s).  For the majority of cases dealing with astronomical data, this is what we are referring to.
  \item Coordinate System: [coords model]  The term 'Coordinate System' is used to mean both ``the space in which a coordinate resides'', and ``a unique domain space, factoring in specific reference frame metadata''.  In this model, we adopt the latter definition.  A Coordinate System provides a complete description of the domain space, including both the coordinate space description and any associated Frame metadata.
\end{itemize}

\noindent This document describes the Coordinates model which provides the metadata describing:
\begin{itemize}
\item the coordinate space; axes, and domain ranges
\item coordinate frames with metadata describing the origin and orientation of the coordinate space
\item a general model for specifying coordinate values within the coordinate space
\item coordinate systems for defining various domain spaces.
\end{itemize}

\section{Use Cases and Requirements}
\label{sect:ucreq}

\subsection{Use Cases}
\label{sect:usecases}

This is a core data model, intended to be used within other models describing higher level products.
As such, there are a vast number of usage threads which the model is required to support.  Rather than
enumerating individual usage threads here, we describe the concepts which must be covered and criteria
which must be met to facilitate these various usage threads.


\subsubsection{Cube model support}
\label{uc:Cube-model-support}
  The primary use case for this work is in support of the Cube Data Model (CubeDM); 
  a N-Dimensional model for pixelated images and sparse cube data.  
  The following is a brief outline of the most relevant features pertaining to the
  development of this model.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item General
    \begin{itemize}
       \item knowledge of the pixel and physical domain spaces provided at a high level
       \begin{itemize}
          \item To support cases like data discovery, where users are interested in the 
            description of the domain space more than in the data itself, this information should 
            be fully encapsulated in a high-level object which may be conveyed independently 
            of the data.
       \end{itemize}
       \item definition of the domain space includes the following criteria
       \begin{itemize}
          \item dimensionality (typically 1,2 or 3 for physical domain), pixel domain may be of any dimension
          \item axis configuration (for spatial domain which has >1D).  The most common configurations for astronomical data are Cartesian and Spherical, but others may be used as well.
          \item domain range along each axis, typically +/- Inf, but may be limited due to physical constraints (e.g. physical size of a detector, sensitivity limitiations, etc)
          \item association with additional metadata further describing the nature of the domain space ( Frame ).  This is especially true for the Spatial and Temporal domains, but may apply to others as well.  Examples include:
          \begin{itemize}
             \item reference position (location of origin)
             \item reference frame (orientation of the domain space)
             \item planetary ephemeris
             \item equinox
          \end{itemize}
          \item Any units associated with the domain specification must be compatible with, but not necessarily identical to units associated with the coordinate values.
          \item To minimize the inclusion of unnecessary, boiler plate content in serializations, the model must not require inclusion of the
                domain space description for commonly used spaces (e.g. the Celestial Sphere). 
       \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Pixelated Image Cube \\
      Pixelated image cubes contain the following concepts relevant to this model.
    \begin{itemize}
       \item complete specification of pixel coordinate domain
       \begin{itemize}
          \item number of axes
          \item number of pixels per axis
       \end{itemize}
       \item mappings of the various pixel axes to corresponding physical axes
       \begin{itemize}
          \item spatial domain typically mapping 2-3 pixel axes to physical axes
          \item other domains are typically 1 dimensional
          \item pixel axes may be involved in multiple mappings to different physical spaces \\
            e.g.:  pixel -> detector and pixel -> sky
       \end{itemize}
       \item mappings may be stacked to define progressive transitions through a domain.  Intermediate stages may or may not be explicitely defined. \\
          e.g.:  pixel -> ccd -> detector -> sky -> wcs
       \item image data value is typically given in a physical domain, but may itself be mapped to other domains
    \end{itemize}
    \item Sparse Cube \\
      The Sparse Cube is structurally different from a Pixelated Image, but contains many of the same concepts.  To facilitate the development
      of efficient, reusable code, the models should use the same objects in these various contexts wherever feasible.
    \begin{itemize}
       \item data axes cover a wide array of physical domains including, but not limited to Spatial, Temporal, Spectral, Polarization
       \item individual domains may be represented multiple times:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item with a shared domain specification (e.g. a 'target' and 'observed' position)
            \item or with different domain specifications (e.g. ccd, detector, sky positions;  pha, energy )
         \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Physical Data (Observables) \\
       Sparse cubes contain a wide variety of observable data.
    \begin{itemize}
       \item It is impractical to describe each as a specialized type, so this model must support a simple description applicable to any 1-dimensional data.
       \item The nature of the observable's domain space fall into 3 main categories:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Continuous data covering a particular range, which may be unbounded.  e.g. position, time, temperature, pressure, magnitude
            \item Binned data, with specified size.  e.g. pulse height channels (pha)
            \item Discrete data, limited to a very specific set of values. e.g. stellar class, polarization state
         \end{itemize}
       \item Observable data values fall into the following categories:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Physical Quantities: value + unit, this form applies to the vast majority of astronomical data.
            \item Binned value: integer value specifying the bin number
            \item Discrete value: often given by an enumeration or vocabulary, these values typically represent a determined or assigned state.
         \end{itemize}
       \item Some observables require the existence of additional metadata in order for clients or applications to properly interpret the value.
             This additional Frame metadata must be easily discovered and accessible from the value.
       \item Examples of some of the more commonly seen domains/data in astronomical data cubes.
       \begin{itemize}      
          \item Spatial
          \begin{itemize}
             \item Cartesian space:  chip, detector, sky
             \item Spherical space: Equatorial, Ecliptic, Galactic, LongLat
          \end{itemize}
          \item Time
          \begin{itemize}
             \item 1-Dimensional: JD, MJD, ISOTime, TimeOffset
          \end{itemize}
          \item Polarization
          \begin{itemize}
             \item Discrete space: Polarization states (Stokes, Linear, Circular, Vector )
          \end{itemize}
          \item Spectral
          \begin{itemize}
             \item 1-Dimensional: energy, frequency, wavelength
          \end{itemize}
       \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Transform workflow}
\label{uc:Transform-workflow}
An implementation project focused on the Transform model. The purpose of which is to exercise the Transform model through a workflow consisting of:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item serialization in YAML of complete WCS metadata, including source/target frames and the various Transform operation sequences between them.
    \item the generation and passing thereof between two Transform library implementations ( AST, gWCS )
  \end{itemize}
  The primary Coordinate model concepts involved in this project are:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Coordinate System: including both the Frame and CoordSpace metadata
    \begin{itemize}
       \item referenced by the transform operations, this metadata must be separable from the other model components.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Coordinates: as the 'input' and 'result' of transform processes.
  \end{itemize}
  
\subsection{Requirements}
\label{sect:reqs}

 Examination and implementation of the above cases leads to a set of requirements distributed through the various STC component models.  Here we 
itemize those relevant to the coordinates model specifically.  We note that some elements of this model are included based on the knowledge and 
experience incorporated into previous STC data model and not from direct requirements from the given use cases.
